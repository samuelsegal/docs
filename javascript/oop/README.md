## OOP ( Object Oriented Programming )  
Abstrating code into real world objects with data and behavior.
* Encapsulation: Binds data and behaviors into one usable units in which the implementation is hidden from users of this function.
* Abstraction: Overiding methods. Also hides information of the underlying functionality while at the same time providing an interface users can further cusomt implementation. THis helps to hide underlying complexities.
* Inheritance: REusability. Also saves memory space.
* Polymorphism: Providing ability for methods to have many forms. Overloading methods. Allowing same methods to bew used in many ways.
