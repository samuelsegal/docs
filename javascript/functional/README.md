## Functional
Similar goals to OOP as far as modularizing. THey both want to seperate code into reusable packages. Functional is different in that it seperates the data from the behavior.
* Pure Functions: All objects are immutable. We avoid shared state.
* No side effects: Do not mutate data, instead return new data. This is how avoid sharing state.
